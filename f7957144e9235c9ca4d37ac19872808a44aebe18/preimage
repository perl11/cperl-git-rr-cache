perlclass - Modern cperl classes and roles

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To declare classes and roles:
X<class> X<role>

    class NAME           { }  # declare a class
    role NAME            { }  # declare a role
    class NAME is PARENT { }  # inherit from one or more classes
    class NAME does ROLE { }  # or roles
    role NAME is PARENT  { }
    role NAME does ROLE  { }

    class NAME {
      has $a;                 # declare a field
      method new ($a?) { bless [$a], $self } # not needed, inherited from Mu
    }
    class NAME :native {      # native C-struct with 2 native int fields
      has int $a = 0;         # for the ffi
      has int $b = 0;
    }

    class NAME :open {        # allows run-time monkey-patching, adding new methods.
      has $a = 0;             # disables most compile-time optimizations.
      has $b = 0;
    }

    my CLASS $obj = CLASS->new; # default object constructor
    $obj->{field};              # fast pseudo-hash syntax, e.g. a getter
    $obj->field = 1;            # slow method syntax, here as setter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document is a reference to Modern Perl programming in cperl with
the introduction of five new builtin keywords: B<class> B<role>
B<method> B<multi> B<has>, enabling the features and performance of
perl6 object orientation into perl5.

A class or a role is a special package, declared as a block with
subroutines, methods and has fields, with dynamic run-time inheritance
from parent classes, compile-time composition of roles, but unlike
perl6 a class or role is closed by default. I.e. the class namespace
and the C<@ISA> and C<@DOES> arrays are readonly.  Old open dynamic classes
can easily be declared with the old package syntax, but methods and
the other new syntax is forbidden there. Only multi subroutines are
allowed outside of classes.

Classes define types, and a hierarchy of types. All variables can be
optionally typed referring to a class, which can be a builtin class
like the coretypes or a user-defined class. See L<perltypes>.  This is
the same as in perl6, but fundamentally different to all the naive
ad-hoc perl5 OO extensions, which treat types as unnecessary and slow
extensions. Types make cperl faster and safer.

The root of the cperl type hierarchy is L<Mu>, every class is a Mu.
The MOP is defined in the L<Metamodel> hierarchy, exactly as in
Perl 6.

=head1 NEW KEYWORDS

=head2 CLASS

A class is a cperl package with a readonly namespace, readonly C<@ISA>
and C<@DOES> arrays for run-time inheritance and compile-time
composition, and with compile-time optimized and type-checked fields
and methods, subroutines and multi methods or subroutines,
i.e. polymorphic dispatch with generics, dispatching on the method
types.

It is different from an old package by being declared via C<use
L<base>> or via the class keyword, and detected by the HvCLASS flag in
the stash. Anonymous classes can only be created via the API, either
using L<perlapi/class_role> and L<perlapi/class_role_finalize>, or
setting C<HvCLASS_on(STASH)> and C<HvROLE_on(STASH)>, or by adding a
class and changing the name to a unique one. Dispatch and inheritance
works on the classnames, not its pointers.

Classes can inherit from classes via a sequence of C<is CLASS> traits
or compose from other roles via C<does ROLE>. Multiple such C<is> or
C<does> traits are allowed.

The B<:native> attribute or B<:repr(CStruct)>, B<:repr(CUnion)> enforces
natively typed access to the fields, with the same layout as in C. It is used
to pass pointers or structs to and from C, e.g. via the L<ffi>. I<(NYI)>

=head2 ROLE

A role is a special class which can be compile-time composed into
other classes or roles via C<does>. All the fields, methods and
subroutines are copied into the child class or role.

If a composed method or field already exists, an error is thrown.

Roles can inherit from classes via a sequence of C<is CLASS> traits or
compose from roles via C<does ROLE>. Multiple such C<is> or C<does>
traits are allowed.

    role MyRole { has $a }
    class MyClass does MyRole {}

    MyClass->new->a = 1; # use the a setter method from MyRole

=head2 METHOD

    method NAME (SIGNATURE) :ATTR BLOCK

The signature is optional and defaults to C<($self)>. C<$self> is
added automatically to all methods as first signature argument.  Using
a different invocant than C<$self> is possible via the invocant
signature syntax C<$this:>, a C<:> suffix.

    method new ($this:, @inits) { bless [@inits], $this }

The declaration is similar to the old-style
C<sub NAME (SIGNATURE) :method BLOCK> declaration, just that with
C<sub :method> the C<$self> argument is not automatically added.

Calling a method as subroutine is forbidden, and
calling a subroutine with a signature as method is forbidden also.
This might bite you with C<use base>, which creates cperl classes.
The new method keyword is only parsed inside a role or class. Outside it
will try to call a subroutine C<method>, which usually doesn't exist.

=head1 MULTI

A multi call polymorphically dispatches on all declared types of the
method or subroutine argument to the best fit of all declared multi
methods or subroutines. The dispatch strategy is left-to-right without
backtracking, not smallest distance from all, as e.g. with perl6 or
L<Class::MultiMethods|http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-Multimethods/>.

    multi method NAME (SIGNATURE) :ATTR BLOCK
    multi sub NAME (SIGNATURE) :ATTR BLOCK
    multi NAME (SIGNATURE) :ATTR BLOCK

The new multi keyword is allowed inside and outside of roles or classes.
The default C<$self> argument is automatically added for multi methods,
as with normal methods.

Internally a multi adds the signature types to the name after a C<\0>.

=head1 HAS

A class or role field is declared via C<has TYPE NAME = value;>, with
the type and the default value being optional, and the name having
optional attributes, same as MY variable declarations. Internally each
has field is declared as my variable, and then changed to field
accessors in all methods.

   has $NAME;
   has @ARRAY;
   has int $i = 0;
   has int $i :const = 0;

Each field generates an entry into the C<@FIELDS> array, used to create
the field accessors at compile-time, plus a C<%FIELDS> hash entry for
run-time access for computed field names, as in C<use L<fields>>.
Native classes requires mandatory types for each field, the layout will aligned
the same as C structs.

Additionally perl6-like accessors are created, for non-const fields
getters and lvalue setter methods, for const fields only getters.

Inside a class C<<< $self->{field} >>> is the same as C<<<
$self->field >>> or just C<$field>.  Outside a class the first two
accessors must be used.  If the name is computed or the field is
inherited from a parent class the lookup will be dynamic via method
inheritance, composed fields from C<does ROLE> compile to direct array
accesses in C<$self>.
