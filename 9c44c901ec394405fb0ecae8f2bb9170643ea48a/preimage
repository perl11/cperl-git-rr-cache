gone.

Parse-CPAN-Meta security: set $YAML::XS::DisableCode, $YAML::XS::DisableBlessed.

improved blockoptions probe when dynaloading fails.

=item YAML::XS  0.75

fixed encoding issues: fixed wrong $YAML::XS::Encoding and
$YAML::XS::LineBreak comparison logic.

modfl() mingw 4.0 runtime bug [perl #125924]

Tested with the comprehensive JSON decode spectests from
http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.html. Not added to core. #72

decode with BOM (UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32). For now only UTF-8,
the others error.

fixed detection of final \0 as illegal non-whitespace garbage. Fixes
spectest 'n_number_then_00'. #72

changed decode of unicode noncharacters between U+FFFD and U+10FFFF
to the recommended U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, when not in the binary
or relaxed mode.

fail decode of non-unicode raw characters above U+10FFFF
when not in relaxed mode.

added F<t/gh70-asan.t>

=item Net-Ping 2.55

Fixed missing C<_unpack_sockaddr_in> family, which took AF_INET6 for

<<<<<<<
=======
Fixed several issues with C<-Duseshrplib>, a shared F<libcperl.$so>:

install it (!!),
fix ExtUtils::Embed and B-C compilation and testing,
fix tests on darwin,
fix configuration probe of Term::ReadKey.

=item *

Fixed C<sv_dump> of fbm-magic strings which did previously contain the wrong
"VALID,EVALED" string for a flag which is either VALID or EVALED. cperl only.

=item *

>>>>>>>
Fixed a cperl-only failure in signatures with default blocks introducing
a new lexical variable. As in C<sub t151($a,$b=do{my $f},$c=1){} t151($x,$x,$x)>.
This failure was only fatal on 32bit + -Duse64bitint systems.

C<SIGNATURE_arg_default_op> does not have a items arg.
See L<[cperl #164]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/164>.

Some of these fixes also can to be backported from perl5.25.x upstream.

C< until ($x = 1) { ... } > and C< ... until $x = 1 > should
warn when syntax warnings are enabled.

C< ${\vec %h, 0, 1} > and C< ${\substr %h, 0} > should not segfault, rather
the lvalue context should be propagated, and list context properly handled.
L<[perl #128260]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128260>

=item *

The perl debugger doesn't yet work with signatures. It doesn't step into
such functions and it may fail.
See e.g. L<[cperl #167]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/167>

=item *

F<t/op/taint.t> contained a test with signatures and 6 default
arguments, which on some 32 bit systems led to random "Reference
parameter cannot take default value at op/taint.t line 2461"
compile-time failures. This test has been rewritten to ony use 4 arguments.

See L<[cperl #164]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/164>

=item *

C<clang -flto=thin> and on some systems even C<gcc -flto> with C<-O3>
or C<-finline> leads to invisible symbols which were inlined and not
exported, even if they should be declared as public API. Work is
ongoing in the F<feature/gh186-lto-thin> branch, but there the
inlining is disabled by the C<used> attribute, leading to a
10% performance regression.  On the other hand a working
C<clang-3.9 -flto> leads to 20% performance improvements.

C< until ($x = 1) { ... } > and C< ... until $x = 1 > should

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<cperlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
For details of how to report the issue.
