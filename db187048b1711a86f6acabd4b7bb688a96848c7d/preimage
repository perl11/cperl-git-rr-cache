=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.29.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the cperl 5.29.1 and the cperl
5.28.0 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as v5.28.1c, first read
L<perl5290cdelta>, which describes differences between v5.28.1c and v5.29.0c.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=item XXX

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

Optimized the static link order of objects for the default case,
when you cannot use lto, pgo, autofdo nor bolt.
Added lto to the default ccflags.
See L<http://perl11.org/blog/bolt.html> and
L<[cperl #381]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/381>.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

[ Within each section, list entries as an =item entry ]

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

<<<<<<<
=item L<B::C> 1.55_10

Better mconcat support. Fix some XS memory leaks.

Add missing optimize flags to F<cc_harness>, F<TestBC.pm> and F<perlcc>,
required for C<-flto>.

When testing overly large C files > 50k (with modules), apply cc -O1,
not -O2 or -O3.

Honor and set SKIP_SLOW_TESTS, set with C<-flto>. Applied to all tests
with large C files. t/c*.t now only execute 13 tests under
-flto/SKIP_SLOW_TESTS and CI, because they may not be finished in
under 10min.
=======
=item L<Opcode> 1.40_04c
>>>>>>>

<<<<<<<
Added a C<is_CI()> test detection.

=item L<Cpanel::JSON::XS> 4.07

Silence Gconvert -Wunused-result.

=item L<ExtUtils::Embed> 1.36

Added optimize to ccopts, required for C<-flto>.
Fixed documentation of ccopts.
Fixed test to use ccopts, include local -I.., indentation,
remove wrong -O hack.

=item L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> 8.35_07

Added C<-flto> support for static libs (need the lto plugin) and D for
deterministic builds, using arflags for AR_STATIC_ARGS, not just 'cr'.
=======
Added the new setstate and keepstate ops, variants of nextstate.

AutoFDO, prelink and BOLT tips.

XXX Changes to F<Configure>, F<installperl>, F<installman>, and analogous tools
go here.  Any other changes to the Perl build process should be listed here.
However, any platform-specific changes should be listed in the
L</Platform Support> section, instead.

[ List changes as an =item entry ].

=item *

Without C<DEBUGGING> the best C<-flto> Link Time Optimization flag is
now added to the default ccflags.
See L<http://perl11.org/blog/bolt.html> and
L<[cperl #381]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/381>.

The correct -flto= variant is then used for ldflags and lddlflags also.
cldflags contains now also the optimize settings, needed for -flto.

ar is replaced by llvm-ar-$ver if needed.

=item *

C<ccname> is now set to "clang" for clang, not "gcc".

=item *

On linux "icc" is also set for C<ccname>, and C<-O3> is preferred over
C<-O2> in most non-DEBUGGING cases with newer compilers.

=item *

C<llvmversion> string added, like "6.0.1-9.1 (tags/RELEASE_601/final)",
analog to C<gccversion>. With clang both variables are set.

=item *

Added C<llvmsuffix> config, for bitcode-enabled ar, ranlib,
llvm-profdata.

=item *

Added C<ar --plugin> path to the F<lto_plugin>, required for static
libs with C<-flto>. Esp. on cygwin.

=item *

Added clang and useshrplib support for the two .autofdo targets.
See L<perlhacktips/AutoFDO>.

=item *

Added two .pgo targets, analog to autofdo. See L<perlhacktips/PGO>.

=item *

Fix forgotten C<ffi_target> XSConfig key. (bug introduced in 5.29.0c)

=item *

Set C<archname> and the target triple C<myarchname> earlier, right
after osname.

=item *

With C<-Uinstallmandirs> all four variables C<installman1dir>,
C<installman3dir>, C<installsiteman1dir> and C<installsiteman3dir> are set to
none, skipping installing all man pages.

=head1 Testing

Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and
changes in this release.  Furthermore, these significant changes were
made:

=over 4

=item *

Added C<is_CI> detection function to F<t/TEST>.

=head2 New Platforms

versions did not.  These will either be enabled by new files in the F<hints/>
directories, or new subdirectories and F<README> files at the top level of the
source tree.

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

=over 4

=item cygwin

Fixed C<boot_Win32CORE> prototype to skip dllexport, fatal with C<-flto>.

Fixed ar for F<Win32CORE.a> by using the gcc liblto plugin.

Skip probing for C<-flto> on 32bit cygwin. This reliably fails to find
a proper image-base with that many new symbols, the adress space is just
too small.

significant internal changes for future core maintainers should be noted as

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<cperlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
For details of how to report the issue.
