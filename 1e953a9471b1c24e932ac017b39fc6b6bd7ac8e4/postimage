=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.27.3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the cperl 5.27.2 and the cperl
5.27.3 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as v5.27.1c, first read
L<perl5272cdelta>, which describes differences between v5.27.1c and v5.27.2c.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

=head2 Disallow illegal glob with embedded NUL

E.g. C<< <$fh\000> >> throws now the safe syscalls warning, and errors
with C<Glob not terminated>, and does not pass the illegal glob path
to the internal or external glob.

This problem was added with v5.27.5 by replacing strchr with memchr,
allowing such illegal strings.
See L<[cperl #342]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/342>

=head2 Follow chroot with chdir("/")

Fixed two security issues with the chroot op:

* fail on embedded NUL in the chroot argument.
Set C<errno> to EINVAL.

* If a call to chroot is not followed by a call to chdir("/") the
chroot jail confinement can be violated.  In Perl_pp_chroot: A call to
chroot followed by an operation that may escape from the chroot jail.
Coverity CID #165302 Insecure chroot.

=head2 Set umask(0600) before calling mkstemp

POSIX 2008 demands such an umask, but it is still problematic on
Solaris, HP-UX and AIX and older libcs, e.g. glibc <= 2.06.
Temporarily set the umask such that the temp. file has 0600 permissions.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 Illegal NUL, syntax error

Embedded NUL bytes read from files, not used in filters, are not
whitespace anymore, they are syntax errors.

See L<[cperl #345]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/345> vs
L<[perl #105920]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=105920>.

Parsing NUL bytes is now consistent from files with eval string.
C<\0> delimited C<q> quote is still valid though.

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 No autovivification of hash slice anymore

This is a new syntax warning, which is deprecated, and will disappear
with v5.30c.  Hash slices and key/value hash slices autovivified in
subroutine arguments. This was a bug, but to check all your code for
correctness and portability we keep this warning for 2 releases.  See
L<[cperl #347]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/347> and
L<perldiag/"No autovivification of hash slice anymore">.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=item XXX

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

=over 4

=item *

All static method calls are now optimized to function calls at compile-time.

Before:

    $ cperl5.27.0d-nt -Dt -e'use strict'
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict.pm"))
    (-e:1)	require
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	pushmark
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict"))
    (-e:1)	method_named(->import)
    (-e:1)	entersub(strict::import)
    (-e:1)	enterxssub(strict::import)
    (-e:1)	leavesub

v5.27.1c:

    $ cperl5.27.1d-nt -Dt -e'use strict'
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict.pm"))
    (-e:1)	require
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	pushmark
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict"))
    (-e:1)	method_named(->import)
    (-e:1)	enterxssub(strict::import)
    (-e:1)	leavesub

v5.27.2c:

    $ cperl5.27.2d-nt -Dt -e'use strict'
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict.pm"))
    (-e:1)	require
    (-e:1)	nextstate
    (-e:1)	pushmark
    (-e:1)	const(PV("strict"))
    (-e:1)	gv(strict::import)
    (-e:1)	enterxssub(strict::import)
    (-e:1)	leavesub

See L<http://blogs.perl.org/users/rurban/2011/06/how-perl-calls-subs-and-methods.html>

We don't yet optimize typed scalars to a static call. We don't walk
the subtypes yet to find the method.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

With a threaded perl, GV's are relocated as READONLY PADs.
Add an abstraction L<perlintern/op_gv_set> to simplify that.

=item *

Removed the obsolete C<OA_PADOP> class. Invalid and unused since 5.6.0.
Kept C<OP_IS_PADOP> and made it legal for threaded perls.
The L<B> modules still print PADOP C<'#'> ops as such, which were dynamically
converted from SVOP's to PADOP's threaded.

=back

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Fixed error message for illegal charnames, and avoid passing NUL into
the charnames lookup, which is a potential security threat.  E.g. on
"\N{TILDE\000}" report "Missing right brace on \\N\{\}" as before
with 5.27.2 and on "\N{TILDE\001}" report "Unknown charname 'TILDE\1'" and
not "Unknown charname 'TILDE'".  perl5.27.5 started reporting those
errors with "Unknown charname 'TILDE'" hiding all characters behind
the embedded NUL or any non-printable character.
L<[cperl #342]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/342>

=item *

Fixed endless loop in the parser with a syntax error on an aborted
class declaration, such as e.g. with C<class $>. The previous behavior
was repeating the warning message C<Bareword found where operator expected>
endlessly.
L<[cperl #346]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/346>

=item *

Fixed autovivifaction of hash slices and key/value hash slices in sub args.
They are now consistent with a list of hash elements.
hash slices still autovivify in for loops.

There's also a new syntax warning about this change,
L<perldiag/"No autovivification of hash slice anymore">
L<[cperl #347]|https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/347>.

=item *

Detect shared-only import libraries like F<libNAME.dll.a>, which have no static
counterpart F<libNAME.a>, which happens e.g. for C<libffi> on B<cygwin> or msys.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<cperlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
For details of how to report the issue.
