=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.25.8

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.25.7 release and the 5.25.8
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.25.6, first read
L<perl5257delta>, which describes differences between 5.25.6 and 5.25.7.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Unescaped literal C<"{"> characters in regular expression
patterns are no longer permissible

You have to now say something like C<"\{"> or C<"[{]"> to specify to
match a LEFT CURLY BRACKET.  This will allow future extensions to the
language.  This restriction is not enforced, nor are there current plans
to enforce it, if the C<"{"> is the first character in the pattern.

These have been deprecated since v5.16, with a deprecation message
displayed starting in v5.22.

=head2 Literal control character variable names are no longer permissible

A variable name may no longer contain a literal control character under
any circumstances.  These previously were allowed in single-character
names on ASCII platforms, but have been deprecated there since Perl
v5.20.  This affects things like C<$I<\cT>>, where I<\cT> is a literal
control (such as a C<NAK> or C<NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGE> character) in the
source code.

=head2 C<qr//xx> is no longer permissible

Using more than one C</x> regular expression pattern modifier on a
single pattern is now forbidden.  This is to allow a future enhancement
to the language.  This usage has been deprecated since v5.22.

=head2 C<NBSP> is no longer permissible in C<\N{...}>

The name of a character may no longer contain non-breaking spaces.  It
has been deprecated to do so since Perl v5.22.

=head2 New Hash Function For 64-bit Builds

We have switched to a hybrid hash function to better balance
performance for short and long keys.

For short keys, 16 bytes and under, we use an optimised variant of
One At A Time Hard, and for longer keys we use Siphash 1-3. For very
long keys this is a big improvement in performance. For shorter keys
there is a modest improvement.

=head2 Use of C<\p{I<script>}> uses the improved Script_Extensions
property

Unicode 6.0 introduced an improved form of the Script (C<sc>) property,
and called it Script_Extensions (C<scx>).  As of now, Perl uses this
improved version when a property is specified as just C<\p{I<script>}>.
The meaning of compound forms, like C<\p{sc=I<script>}> are unchanged.
This should make programs be more accurate when determining if a
character is used in a given script, but there is a slight chance of
breakage for programs that very specifically needed the old behavior.
See L<perlunicode/Scripts>.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=item XXX

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here.
There may well be none in a stable release.

[ List each enhancement as a =item entry ]

=item * New Faster Hash Function on 64 bit builds

We use a different hash function for short and long keys. This should
improve performance and security, especially for long keys.

=item * readline is faster

Reading from a file line-by-line with c<readline()> or C<< <> >> should
now typically be faster due to a better implementation of the code that
searches for the next newline character.

=back

=head2 C<scalar(%hash)> return signature changed

The value returned for C<scalar(%hash)> will no longer show information
about the buckets allocated in the hash. It will simply return the count
of used keys. It is thus equivalent to C<0+keys(%hash)>.

A form of backwards compatibility is provided via C<Hash::Util::bucket_ratio()>
which provides the same behavior as scalar(%hash) provided prior to
Perl 5.25.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

L<POSIX> has been upgraded from version 1.66 to 1.69. This remedies several
defects in making its symbols exportable. [perl #127821]
The C<POSIX::tmpnam()> interface has been removed,
see L<perl5251delta/"POSIX::tmpnam() has been removed">.
Trying to import POSIX subs that have no real implementations
(like C<POSIX::atend()>) now fails at import time, instead of
waiting until runtime.

Unescaped left braces are already illegal in some contexts in regular

This warning is now raised in these contexts.

<<<<<<<
A new API function, C<sv_set_undef(sv)>, has been added. This is
equivalent to C<sv_setsv(sv, &PL_sv_undef)>, but is more efficient.

=item *

The function C<L<perlapi/utf8n_to_uvchr>> has been changed to not
abandon searching for other malformations when the first one is
encountered.  A call to it thus can generate multiple diagnostics,
instead of just one.

=item *

A new function, C<L<perlapi/utf8n_to_uvchr_error>>, has been added for
use by modules that need to know the details of UTF-8 malformations
beyond pass/fail.  Previously, the only ways to know why a sequence was
ill-formed was to capture and parse the generated diagnostics, or to do
your own analysis.
=======
Calling macros like C<isALPHA_utf8> on malformed UTF-8 have issued a
deprecation warning since Perl v5.18.  They now die.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.
