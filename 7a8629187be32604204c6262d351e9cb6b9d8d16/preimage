perldelta - what is new for perl v5.22.2
>>>>>>>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.22.1 release and the 5.22.2
release.

<<<<<<<
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.22.0, first read
L<perl5221delta>, which describes differences between 5.22.0 and 5.22.1.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]
=======
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.22.1, first read
L<perl5221delta>, which describes differences between 5.22.1 and 5.22.2.

=head1 Notice

B<cperl note>: Some perl-5.22.2 fixes from the maint-5.22 branch are
broken and were fixed in cperl-5.22.2 before properly. p5p does not
really understand its codebase and refuses to take our bugreports and
proper fixes, so usage of perl-5.22.2 is B<officially discouraged>.
The official explanation of p5p is refering to their new code of
conduct, which now disallows criticsm on their broken development.

=head1 Security

=head2 Fix out of boundary access in Win32 path handling

This is CVE-2015-8608.  For more information see
L<[perl #126755]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126755>

=head2 Fix loss of taint in C<canonpath()>

This is CVE-2015-8607.  For more information see
L<[perl #126862]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126862>

=head2 Set proper umask before calling C<mkstemp(3)>

In 5.22 perl started setting umask to C<0600> before calling C<mkstemp(3)>
and restoring it afterwards. This wrongfully tells C<open(2)> to strip
the owner read and write bits from the given mode before applying it,
rather than the intended negation of leaving only those bits in place.

Systems that use mode C<0666> in C<mkstemp(3)> (like old versions of
glibc) createa a file with permissions C<0066>, leaving world read and
write permissions regardless of current umask.

This has been fixed by using umask C<0177> instead.

L<[perl #127322]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127322>

=head2 Avoid accessing uninitialized memory in win32 C<crypt()>

Added validation that will detect both a short salt and invalid characters
in the salt.  L<[perl #126922]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126922>

=head2 Remove duplicate environment variables from C<environ>

Previously, if an environment variable appeared more than once in
C<environ[]>, C<%ENV> would contain the last entry for that name,
while a typical C<getenv()> would return the first entry. We now
make sure C<%ENV> contains the same as what C<getenv> returns.

Second, we remove duplicates from C<environ[]>, so if a setting
with that name is set in C<%ENV> we won't pass an unsafe value
to a child process.

This is L<CVE-2016-2381|https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2381>

=head1 Incompatible Changes

<<<<<<<
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.22.1 other than the
following single exception, which we deemed to be a sensible change to make in
order to get the new C<\b{wb}> and (in particular) C<\b{sb}> features sane
before people decided they're worthless because of bugs in their Perl 5.22.0
implementation and avoided them in the future.

If any others exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.
See L</Reporting Bugs> below.
=======
XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:
>>>>>>>

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

C<Configure> now acts as if the C<-O> option is always passed, allowing command

permitted, but ignored.

Dtrace builds now build sucessfully on systems with a newer dtrace
that require an input object file that uses the probes in the F<.d>
file.

Previously the probe would fail and cause a build failure.

PowerPC) is now detected correctly.

=item OS X/Darwin

Builds with both B<-DDEBUGGING> and threading enabled would fail with a "panic:
free from wrong pool" error when built or tested from Terminal on OS X.  This
was caused by perl's internal management of the environment conflicting with an
atfork handler using the libc C<setenv()> function to update the environment.

Perl now uses C<setenv()>/C<unsetenv()> to update the environment on OS X.

<<<<<<<
C<\b{sb}> works much better.  In Perl v5.22.0, this new construct didn't
seem to give the expected results, yet passed all the tests in the
extensive suite furnished by Unicode.  It turns out that it was because
these were short input strings, and the failures had to do with longer
inputs.  This was fixed in Perl 5.23.4, but the improvement was not
noticed until after that was released, so is included here now.

=item *

Certain syntax errors in
L<perlrecharclass/Extended Bracketed Character Classes> caused panics
instead of the proper error message.  This has now been fixed. [perl

=item *

Calls to the placeholder C<&PL_sv_yes> used internally when an

context.
L<[perl #126042]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126042>

=item *

The C<pipe()> operator would assert for C<DEBUGGING> builds instead of
producing the correct error message.  The condition asserted on is
detected and reported on correctly without the assertions, so the
assertions were removed.

In some cases, failing to parse a here-doc would attempt to use freed

Another hexadecimal floating point bug, causing low-order bits to be lost in

If a here-doc was found while parsing another operator, the parser had
already read end of file, and the here-doc was not terminated, perl
could produce an assertion or a segmentation fault.  This now reliably

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
