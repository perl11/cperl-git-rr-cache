=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.22.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.22.1 release and the 5.22.2
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.22.1, first read
L<perl5221delta>, which describes differences between 5.22.1 and 5.22.2.

=head1 Notice

B<cperl note>: Some perl-5.22.2 fixes from the maint-5.22 branch are
broken and were fixed in cperl-5.22.2 before properly. p5p does not
understand its codebase and refuses to take our bugreports and proper
fixes, so usage of perl-5.22.2 is B<officially discouraged>.  The
official explanation of p5p is refering to their new code of conduct,
which now disallows criticsm on their broken development management.

=head1 Security

=head2 Fix out of boundary access in Win32 path handling

This is CVE-2015-8608.  For more information see
L<[perl #126755]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126755>

=head2 Fix loss of taint in C<canonpath()>

This is CVE-2015-8607.  For more information see
L<[perl #126862]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126862>

=head2 Set proper umask before calling C<mkstemp(3)>

In 5.22 perl started setting umask to C<0600> before calling C<mkstemp(3)>
and restoring it afterwards. This wrongfully tells C<open(2)> to strip
the owner read and write bits from the given mode before applying it,
rather than the intended negation of leaving only those bits in place.

Systems that use mode C<0666> in C<mkstemp(3)> (like old versions of
glibc) createa a file with permissions C<0066>, leaving world read and
write permissions regardless of current umask.

This has been fixed by using umask C<0177> instead.

L<[perl #127322]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127322>

=head2 Avoid accessing uninitialized memory in win32 C<crypt()>

Added validation that will detect both a short salt and invalid characters
in the salt.  L<[perl #126922]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126922>

=head2 Remove duplicate environment variables from C<environ>

Previously, if an environment variable appeared more than once in
C<environ[]>, C<%ENV> would contain the last entry for that name,
while a typical C<getenv()> would return the first entry. We now
make sure C<%ENV> contains the same as what C<getenv> returns.

Second, we remove duplicates from C<environ[]>, so if a setting
with that name is set in C<%ENV> we won't pass an unsafe value
to a child process.

This is L<CVE-2016-2381|https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2381>

=head1 Incompatible Changes

There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.22.1 other than the
following single exception, which we deemed to be a sensible change to make in
order to get the new C<\b{wb}> and (in particular) C<\b{sb}> features sane
before people decided they're worthless because of bugs in their Perl 5.22.0
implementation and avoided them in the future.

If any others exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.
See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

=head2 Bounds Checking Constructs

Several bugs, including a segmentation fault, have been fixed with the bounds
checking constructs (introduced in Perl 5.22) C<\b{gcb}>, C<\b{sb}>, C<\b{wb}>,
C<\B{gcb}>, C<\B{sb}>, and C<\B{wb}>.  All the C<\B{}> ones now match an empty
string; none of the C<\b{}> ones do.

The C<printf> and C<sprintf> builtins are now more careful about the warnings
they emit: argument reordering now disables the "redundant argument" warning in
all cases.

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

=over 4

=item *

Using the C<NO_HASH_SEED> define in combination with the default hash algorithm
C<PERL_HASH_FUNC_ONE_AT_A_TIME_HARD> resulted in a fatal error while compiling
the interpreter, since Perl 5.17.10.  This has been fixed.

=item *

Configuring with ccflags containing quotes (e.g.
C<< -Accflags='-DAPPLLIB_EXP=\"/usr/libperl\"' >>) was broken in Perl 5.22.0
but has now been fixed again.
L<[perl #125314]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125314>

=item *

C<Configure> now acts as if the C<-O> option is always passed, allowing command
line options to override saved configuration.  This should eliminate confusion
when command line options are ignored for no obvious reason.  C<-O> is now
permitted, but ignored.

=item *

Dtrace builds now build sucessfully on systems with a newer dtrace
that require an input object file that uses the probes in the F<.d>
file.

Previously the probe would fail and cause a build failure.

L<[perl #122287]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122287>

=item *

F<Configure> no longer probes for F<libnm> by default.  Originally
this was the "New Math" library, but the name has been re-used by the
GNOME NetworkManager.

L<[perl #127131]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127131>

Regular expression possessive quantifier Perl 5.20 regression now fixed.
C<qr/>I<PAT>C<{>I<min>,I<max>C<}+>C</> is supposed to behave identically to
C<qr/(?E<gt>>I<PAT>C<{>I<min>,I<max>C<})/>.  Since Perl 5.20, this didn't work

Certain syntax errors in

=item *

A regression from Perl 5.20 has been fixed, in which some syntax errors in
L<C<(?[...])>|perlrecharclass/Extended Bracketed Character Classes> constructs
within regular expression patterns could cause a segfault instead of a proper
error message.
L<[perl #126180]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126180>

Another problem with
L<C<(?[...])>|perlrecharclass/Extended Bracketed Character Classes>
constructs has been fixed wherein things like C<\c]> could cause panics.
L<[perl #126181]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126181>

=item *

In Perl 5.22.0, the logic changed when parsing a numeric parameter to the -C
option, such that the successfully parsed number was not saved as the option
value if it parsed to the end of the argument.
L<[perl #125381]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125381>

=item *

Warning fatality is now ignored when rewinding the stack.  This prevents
infinite recursion when the now fatal error also causes rewinding of the stack.
L<[perl #123398]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123398>

=item *

A crash with C<< %::=(); J->${\"::"} >> has been fixed.
L<[perl #125541]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125541>

=item *

Nested quantifiers such as C</.{1}??/> should cause perl to throw a fatal
error, but were being silently accepted since Perl 5.20.0.  This has been
fixed.
L<[perl #126253]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126253>

=item *

Regular expression sequences such as C</(?i/> (and similarly with other
recognized flags or combination of flags) should cause perl to throw a fatal
error, but were being silently accepted since Perl 5.18.0.  This has been
fixed.
L<[perl #126178]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126178>

=item *

A bug in hexadecimal floating point literal support meant that high-order bits
could be lost in cases where mantissa overflow was caused by too many trailing
zeros in the fractional part.  This has been fixed.
L<[perl #126582]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126582>

=item *

C<\b{sb}> works much better.  In Perl v5.22.0, this new construct didn't
seem to give the expected results, yet passed all the tests in the
extensive suite furnished by Unicode.  It turns out that it was because
these were short input strings, and the failures had to do with longer
inputs.  This was fixed in Perl 5.23.4, but the improvement was not
noticed until after that was released, so is included here now.

=item *

Certain syntax errors in
L<perlrecharclass/Extended Bracketed Character Classes> caused panics
instead of the proper error message.  This has now been fixed. [perl

=item *

Calls to the placeholder C<&PL_sv_yes> used internally when an
C<import()> or C<unimport()> method isn't found now correctly handle scalar
context.
L<[perl #126042]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126042>

=item *

The C<pipe()> operator would assert for C<DEBUGGING> builds instead of
producing the correct error message.  The condition asserted on is
detected and reported on correctly without the assertions, so the
assertions were removed.
L<[perl #126480]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126480>

=item *

In some cases, failing to parse a here-doc would attempt to use freed
memory.  This was caused by a pointer not being restored correctly.
L<[perl #126443]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126443>

=item *

Another hexadecimal floating point bug, causing low-order bits to be lost in
cases where the last hexadecimal digit of the mantissa has bits straddling the
limit of the number of bits allowed for the mantissa, has also been fixed.
L<[perl #126586]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126586>

=item *

Further hexadecimal floating point bugs have been fixed: In some circumstances,
the C<%a> format specifier could variously lose the sign of the negative zero,
fail to display zeros after the radix point with the requested precision, or
even lose the radix point after the leftmost hexadecimal digit completely.

=item *

A crash caused by incomplete expressions within C<< /(?[ ])/ >> (e.g.
C<< /(?[[0]+()+])/ >>) has been fixed.
L<[perl #126615]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126615>

Report more context when we see an array where we expect to see an
operator and avoid an assertion failure. 
L<[perl #123737]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123737>

=item *

If a here-doc was found while parsing another operator, the parser had
already read end of file, and the here-doc was not terminated, perl
could produce an assertion or a segmentation fault.  This now reliably
complains about the unterminated here-doc.

Avoid parsing beyond the end of the buffer when processing a C<#line>
directive with no filename.
L<[perl #127334]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127334>

=item *

Perl 5.22 added support to the C99 hexadecimal floating point notation,
but sometimes misparses hex floats. This had been fixed.

[perl #127183]

=item *

Certain regex patterns involving a complemented posix class in an
inverted bracketed character class, and matching something else
optionally would improperly fail to match.  An example of one that could
fail is C</qr/_?[^\Wbar]\x{100}/>.  This has been fixed.

As an optimization, C<uc()>, C<lc()>, C<ucfirst()> and C<lcfirst()> sometimes
modify their argument in-place rather than returning a modified copy, as of
Perl 5.20.0.  The critera for this optimization has been made stricter to avoid
these functions accidentally modifying in-place when they should not, which has
been happening in some cases, e.g. in L<List::Util>.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
