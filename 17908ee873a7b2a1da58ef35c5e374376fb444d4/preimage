=head1 NAME

perlcdelta - what is new for cperl v5.28.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the differences between the cperl 5.28.1
and the cperl 5.28.2 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as v5.26.0c, first
read the L<perl526*cdelta> documentation, which describes differences
between v5.26.0c and v5.26.3c

=head2 [CVE-2018-18311] Integer overflow leading to buffer overflow and segmentation fault

Integer arithmetic in C<Perl_my_setenv()> could wrap when the combined length
of the environment variable name and value exceeded around 0x7fffffff.  This
could lead to writing beyond the end of an allocated buffer with attacker
supplied data.

L<[perl #133204]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133204>

=head2 Restrict my_setenv to ARG_MAX

perl5 fixed C<Perl_my_setenv()> by allowing C<%ENV> sizes larger than
C<ARG_MAX> (typically 128Kb), up to 2GB. This is considered a security
risk. It writes onto the kernel stack, even if often caught by MAXEXECARGS
"Argument list too long" kernel errors on the next exec call.
cperl disallows C<%ENV> larger than the sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX)/MAX_ARG_STRLEN/
ARG_MAX/NCARGS size with a new L<perldiag/"Environment size %d larger than the allowed %d">
error.

=head2 [CVE-2018-18312] Heap-buffer-overflow write in S_regatom (regcomp.c)

A crafted regular expression could cause heap-buffer-overflow write during
compilation, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.

=over 4

<<<<<<<
=======
=item L<B::C> 1.55_10

Better mconcat support. Fix some XS memory leaks.

Add missing optimize flags to F<cc_harness>, F<TestBC.pm> and F<perlcc>,
required for C<-flto>.

When testing overly large C files > 50k (with modules), apply cc -O1,
not -O2 or -O3.

Honor and set SKIP_SLOW_TESTS, set with C<-flto>. Applied to all tests
with large C files. t/c*.t now only execute 13 tests under
-flto/SKIP_SLOW_TESTS and CI, because they may not be finished in
under 10min.

Added a C<is_CI()> test detection.

=item L<Cpanel::JSON::XS> 4.09

Silence Gconvert -Wunused-result.

Add unblessed_bool property (PR #118 by Pali)

Add seperate allow_dupkeys property, in relaxed (#122),
Fixed allow_dupkeys for the XS slow path,
Silence 2 -Wunused-value warnings,
Fix ->unblessed_bool to produce modifiable perl structures (PR #121 by Pali).

=item L<ExtUtils::Embed> 1.36

Added optimize to ccopts, required for C<-flto>.
Fixed documentation of ccopts.
Fixed test to use ccopts, include local -I.., indentation,
remove wrong -O hack.

=item L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> 8.35_07

Added C<-flto> support for static libs (need the lto plugin) and D for
deterministic builds, using arflags for AR_STATIC_ARGS, not just 'cr'.

=item L<Win32> 0.52_02

Fix various -Wunused warnings, added () usage croaks.
Fixed a -Warray-bounds buffer overflow in LONGPATH,
and two -Wmaybe-uninitialized.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Perl 5.28 introduced an C<index()> optimization when comparing to -1 (or
indirectly, e.g. >= 0).  When this optimization was triggered inside a C<when>
clause it caused a warning ("Argument %s isn't numeric in smart match").  This
has now been fixed.
L<[perl #133368]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133368>

=item *

Matching of decimal digits in script runs, introduced in Perl 5.28, had a bug
that led to C<"1\N{THAI DIGIT FIVE}"> matching C</^(*sr:\d+)$/> when it should
not.  This has now been fixed.

=item *

The new in-place editing code no longer leaks directory handles.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<cperlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If you think it's a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more 
please file an issue at L<https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues>.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
For details of how to report the issue.
